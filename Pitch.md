# MeritX Pitch

## What are you building?

MeritX is an AI-powered intake and workflow system for consultation-heavy law firms, such as immigration, family, and civil practices.

We turn client consultation calls into structured intake records, automated follow-ups, client checklists, and billable workflows.

Instead of leaving critical work in audio and memory, we make every consultation operational, trackable, and secure.

## What problem are you solving?

In consultation-driven practices, firms spend enormous time after each call just organizing information and chasing clients.

Calls are unstructured. Follow-ups are slow. Documents are missing. Pre-matter work is not tracked.

As a result, firms lose potential clients and waste hours on manual coordination.

In many firms, pre-litigation intake alone takes up 30–50% of total case time.

### How do law firms solve this today?

They use a combination of:

- Phone / Zoom

- Email

- Docs

- Case management

- Billing tools

Paralegals manually connect everything.

AI transcription tools exist, but they stop at text and don’t create real workflows.

### How is your solution different?

MeritX turns every consultation into a complete operational workflow:

- A structured intake record

- A confirmation email package

- Automated tasks and reminders

- A client document checklist

- Suggested time entries

All in one workflow.

This helps firms close the loop with clients faster and more consistently.

In pilots, we aim to reduce intake and follow-up time by up to 80%.

## Who is your customer?

Our initial customers are consultation-heavy small and mid-sized law firms, especially in:

- Immigration

- Family law

- Civil and personal matters

Primary buyers are managing partners and firm administrators.

Primary users are paralegals, intake specialists, and legal assistants.

## Why are you the right team?

We combine deep legal expertise with strong technical execution.

One co-founder is a practicing attorney who understands intake, evidence, and compliance requirements.

The other is a technical founder who builds secure, scalable systems and workflow infrastructure for complex, real-world operations.

This allows us to translate real legal processes into reliable software that firms can trust.

## Why now?

- Modern speech recognition and LLMs enable reliable extraction and drafting.

- Law firms are facing staff shortages and rising acquisition costs.

- Clients expect faster responses and clearer communication.

## How do you make money?

- We charge a subscription per seat plus usage-based pricing per consultation.

- We start with intake teams and expand to firm-wide adoption.

- Additional revenue comes from integrations, analytics, and compliance features.

## What traction do you have?

We are at the early validation stage.

One co-founder has interviewed multiple immigration and family law attorneys and intake managers to understand their workflows and pain points.

Across these conversations, firms consistently reported spending several hours per consultation on follow-ups, document collection, and coordination.

Several firms have expressed interest in piloting a solution once a working prototype is available.

We are currently building our first MVP and onboarding design partners.
